# friskyretro-78467
A simple, agile retrospective board.

It's all hacked together fairly quickly, so the code is ugly and I'm sure not at all the way it would be done by someone that knows what they are doing with these frameworks. I built it just as a first experiment with node.js, reactjs and sqlite.

To get it up and running locally, you'll need to run the following commands from a command line:

From the root folder of the project:<br />
*npm install*

Then change into the client directory:<br />
*cd client*

*npm run build*

Then back to the root folder:<br />
*cd ..*<br />
*npm start*

That will launch it on localhost:5000. Open up that url in your web browser.
